## Hello World! 👋

### 😎 Who I am

My name is Bruno da Hora, I am a developer that loves to build and deliver high-quality work that fils our customers needs.

I am currently working as React developer and love the ecossystem. But I have already worked with multiple stacks, as Java, Android, PHP and Ruby.

I have a Bachelor and Masters in Computer Science from USP and I live in Curitiba, Paraná in Brasil.

### 👷 What I am doing

I work as Senior Frontend Developer at Pipefy, a product that helps thousands of doers to manage their processes, improver their productivity and focus on doing, instead of managing the software.

There I am responsible to build new features, mantain and improve our codebase as well as mentor and help the team as a senior developer.

### 📖 What I am learning

I have gone deep into the React ecossystem and I have been studying a lot on this, but other than that, I have been studiying the following topics:

- React/Web Performance and metrics
- What is to be a Staff Engineer/Tech Lead
- Learning more about Typescript
- Accessibility

I also am passionate by agile and lean topics and learn how to improve our processes as well.
